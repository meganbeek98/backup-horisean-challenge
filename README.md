horisean-challenge
<HTML> and <CSS> files

In this project I have added more Functionality and Accessibility features to the webpage for:
    Horisean- Social Solutions Services, Inc.

<!-- Some Functionality and Accessibility features I have added within the HTML and CSS code are as follows: -->
    - added a necessary title for the browser to show (there was no title before)
    - added Semantic HTML elements for smoother and more descriptive human- and machine-reading of the code (i.e.- replaced many <div> elements with more decriptive elements)
    - added descriptive and concise alternatives (alt="") for a screen-reader/narrator to read (or not to read) to the user when scanning images on the page
    - changed many font-sizes for better visability
    - added some CSS selectors for certain issues (i.e.- text-align)
    - renamed existing CSS selectors to names that are more simple and logical
    - grouped together many CSS selectors, eliminating some very repetitive code
    - added id's for better navigation
    - added notes and indentation where needed for main section's beginning and end points-- making it easier to edit the code in the future if needed
<!-- additions are noted throughout the HTML and CSS code-->

I owe credit and thanks to the following sources for helping me with my project:
    - MDN Web Docs, for the many pages I referenced regarding the topic of "Accessibility" and "CSS Posistioning"
    - Many AskBCS Learning Assistants in Slack, for solutions to issues resulting from code errors
    - My instructor Slavic, for the knowledge I gained from his classes
    - The OSU Coding Bootcamp's Module 1, for the knowledge I gained from its lessons
    - Youtube, for many intructional "how-to" videos
    - Lastly, and certainly not least-- Google, for all the questions I needed quick answers for
